/**
 * @author James M Snell (jasnell@us.ibm.com)
 * 
 * Extension Factories are used to provide a means of dynamically resolving
 * builders for namespaced extension elements
 * 
 * There are four ways of supporting extension elements.
 * 
 * 1. Implement your own Factory (hard)
 * 2. Subclass the default Axiom-based Factory (also somewhat difficult)
 * 3. Implement and register an ExtensionFactory (wonderfully simple)
 * 4. Use the Feed Object Model's dynamic support for extensions (also very simple)
 * 
 * Registering an Extension Factory requires generally nothing more than 
 * implementing ExtensionFactory and then creating the file 
 * META-INF/services/org.apache.abdera.factory.ExtensionFactory and listing
 * the class names of each ExtensionFactory you wish to register.
 * 
 * Note that at this time, ExtensionFactories are specific to the parser 
 * implementation used.  That is, if you're using the default StAX-based 
 * FOMParser and FOMFactory implementation, your ExtensionFactores will 
 * need to also implement FOMExtensionFactory.
