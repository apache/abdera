Apache Abdera
============================

Apache Abdera is a high-performance, functionally complete
implementation of the IETF Atom Syndication Format (RFC 4287) and Atom
Publishing Protocol specifications.

Incubation Disclaimer
============================

Abdera is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
ASF projects.  While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection
of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that
the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Export Notice
============================
   This distribution includes cryptographic software.  The country in 
   which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import, 
   possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of 
   encryption software.  BEFORE using any encryption software, please 
   check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the
   import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to 
   see if this is permitted.  See <http://www.wassenaar.org/> for more

   Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity 
   Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security
   software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
   algorithms.  The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
   distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
   ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS 
   Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object 
   code and source code.
