/**
 * <p>Represents an Atom Publishing Protocol <code>control</code> element.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The purpose of the control extension is to provide a means for content
 * publishers to embed various publishing-operation specific control parameters
 * within the body of the entry.  For instance, the client may wish to mark the
 * entry as a draft, or may wish to ask the publishing server to enable or 
 * disable specific extended features for a given entry.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>Per APP Draft-08:</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   pubControl =
 *      element pub:control {
 *      atomCommonAttributes,
 *      pubDraft?
 *      &amp; extensionElement
 *   }
 *
 *   pubDraft =
 *     element pub:draft { "yes" | "no" }
 *
 *  The "pub:control" element MAY appear as a child of an "atom:entry"
 *  which is being created or updated via the Atom Publishing Protocol.
 *  The "pub:control" element, if it does appear in an entry, MUST only
 *  appear at most one time.  The "pub:control" element is considered
 *  foreign markup as defined in Section 6 of [RFC4287].
 *
 *  The "pub:control" element and its child elements MAY be included in
 *  Atom Feed or Entry Documents.
 *
 *  The "pub:control" element MAY contain exactly one "pub:draft" element
 *  as defined here, and MAY contain zero or more extension elements as
 *  outlined in Section 6 of [RFC4287].  Both clients and servers MUST
 *  ignore foreign markup present in the pub:control element.
 * </pre>
