/**
 * In the Atom Publishing Protocol, the Slug HTTP header is used to allow
 * a client to provide text that can be used to create a human-friendly
 * URL for an entry.  For instance, in many weblog software packages, it 
 * is not uncommon to find entries whose permalink URL's look like /my_trip_to_the_zoo.
 * 
 * Slug text provided by the client, however, may not be directly suitable 
 * for use within a URL.  It may, for instance, contain non-ascii characters,
 * whitespace, or characters not allowed within a URL.  The Sanitizer class
 * will take input text and output a modified result suitable for use in URL's
