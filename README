Apache Abdera
============================

Apache Abdera is a high-performance, functionally complete
implementation of the IETF Atom Syndication Format (RFC 4287) and Atom
Publishing Protocol specifications.

Incubation Disclaimer
============================

Abdera is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful
ASF projects.  While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection
of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that
the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
